# AyHa1810Bot-Discord

Some simple $#!tty public codes for my bot :P \
Also I don't know how to name something lol

## Install
Installing this shouldn't be that hard :P

First, rename the `example.env` file to `.env`file. \
Then put your bot token and your discord user ID in \
the required fields of the `.env` file.

For rest of the dependencies in `package.json` or \
`package-lock.json`, you can install them using the \
following: \
